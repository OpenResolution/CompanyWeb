            Traditional 3D SMLM techniques often rely on a pre-determined model, typically built by scanning tiny
            fluorescent beads along the vertical (z-axis) of the microscope.
            <br><br>

            However, In situ PSF retrieval (INSPR) has an edgeâ€”it constructs a 3D image using the actual data from
            individual light-emitting molecules. This means it can pinpoint the exact locations of these molecules
            with incredible accuracy and detail.
            <br><br>
            How does it do this? INSPR takes cues from mathematical principles, specifically
            expectation-maximization, and k-means. It focuses on the precise positions of individual molecules
            vertically and horizontally.
            <br><br>
            Imagine a microscope's lens as the "pupil" through which it sees. The way light passes through this
            pupil and scatters is described by the point spread function (PSF). INSPR's goal is to understand this
            light scattering pattern at different depths.
            <br><br>
            The INSPR method involves two main steps:
          </p>
          <p class="main_text">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.Assignment: It starts with a basic, idealized understanding of light scattering. Then, each detected
            light pattern from individual molecules is linked to a specific depth based on how closely it matches
            this ideal.
          </p>
          <p class="main_text">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.Update: All the light patterns at a specific depth are grouped together and refined to create a
            clearer, more accurate model of light scattering at that depth.
          </p>
          <p class="main_text">
            These two steps are repeated repeatedly, each time refining the model, until the method produces a
            consistent and detailed 3D image.
