              To generate super-resolution images, Single-molecule localization microscope (SMLM) requires intensive
              computation process. Current solutions, including commercialized products, mandate a two-step process:
              first, the acquisition of the dataset, followed by its processing. This sequential approach means users
              cannot visualize the image in real-time during acquisition, leaving them in the dark about their sample
              until post-processing.
            </p>
            <p class="main_text">
              Recognizing this issue, we reprogrammed the state-of-the-art SMLM reconstruction algorithm in Taichi-a
              high-performance parallel computation framework, accelerating the reconstruction speed hundreds of times
              faster than the serial processing CPU approach. We name this program TurboSMLM. Given TurboSMLMâ€™s
              superior reconstruction speed surpasses the image acquisition speed, we can process data during
              acquisition, providing a near real-time image reconstruction on SMLM system. Users could access the
              super-resolution image while taking images.
